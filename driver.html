        <h2>Right (the ball is going outwards)</h2>
        <p>If your ball is going left, you should spin your body more and make sure that your belly button faces where you are aiming at the end of your swing.<p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Left (the ball is going behind you)</h2>
        <img src="images/left wrist.jpeg" alt="demonstration">
        <p>When your ball is going to the left, you should bend your non-dominant hand's wrist at the top of your swing. Make sure to keep that you keep this angle of your wrist as you swing down.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Slice</h2>
        <img src="images/3 oclock 2.jpeg" alt="demonstration">
        <p>When you are at the 9 o'clock position in your downswing, make the club point slightly behind you, like the picture.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Hook</h2>
        <p>Once you finish your backswing, don't bend your wrists until you are past the 3 o'clock angle. As you swing, don't drag your hands past yourself in your follow through and leave your hands in front of you. You should also stop flipping your hands so that your dominant hands comes on top as you swing.</p>
        <p>I asked my brother what he would do and he told me that he would try not to push his hips outwards and to keep his left armpits closed.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h2>Duff</h2>
        <p>If I were duffing the ball a lot, I would make sure that my spine is not tilting to the left or the right side as I swing. My weight should also be on my non-dominantfoot once I finish my swing.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Top</h2>
        <p>Whenever you am hitting the ball thin, or if you are hitting the top of the ball, you should keep your head down until you are past the 4 o'clock postion, but make sure that you are spinning your body. Keep in mind that you are supposed to the hit the top of the ball, but the club should lso hit the ground in front of the ball, if you are hitting an iron.</p>
