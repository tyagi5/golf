        <h2>Sand Wedge Shots</h2>
        <img src="images/sandwedge.jpeg" alt="sand wedge">
        <p>Although hitting with a sand wedge and a 7 iron may not seem that different, they are actually very different.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <li>Place your ball a a couple of inches back</li>
            <li>Angle your club face down</li>
            <li>Hit the ball from above with you club angled down as possible. It should feel like you are hitting the ball like the image.</li>
            <li>The ball should go left so hit it to the right (for right-handed players)</li>
            <li>You need to practice a lot to get the hang of it and to get the right distance.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Trouble Shots</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure that your club gace is steeper than usual</li>
            <li>Don't swing all the way back, you just need to get it somewhere on the fairway so you can hit your next shot</li>
            <li>Don't be hesitant to leave divots as long as it is in front of the ball</li>
            <li>Hit the ball as low and straight as you can</li>
            <li>Know how far your ball will go, or have a vague distnace, based on  each club. My ball goes about 75% of the distance my ball usually goes, but the distance changes based on where I hit it</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Bunker Shots</h2>
        <img src="images/bunker.jpeg" alt="bunker shot">
        <ul>
            <li>The most important part about Bunker Shots are to get the ball out of the bunker. Many people try to get it close to the hole and they fail to get the ball out of the bunker</li>
            <li>Don't be afraid to take a lot of backswing. If you don't swing past the 9 o'clock position, you are likely to fail getting the ball out of the bunker</li>
            <li>Find the perfect spot that you have to aim for to hit the ball successfully.</li>
            <li>Flick your wrists once you hit the ball and are at the 4 or 5 o'clock position</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the sand is hard:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't lay your club face down too much like normal bunker shots</li>
            <li>Hit closer to the ball than usual</li>
            <li>Hit harder than usual to make sure that the hard sand doesn't slow down you club</li>
            <li>Don't worry about your follow through</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
