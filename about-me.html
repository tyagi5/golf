    <h2>My Golf Journey</h2>
    <img src="images/little1.jpg" alt="a photo of me when I was little">
    <p>I started playing golf when I moved to Irvine when I was in second grade. My dad was the one who had introduced me to golf. When I was in 3rd or 4th grade, I stopping playing golf for about a year, before I started playing golf again and going on tournaments. My first golf "game" wasn't really a game. It was just a bunch of Japanese people who had gathered a group and played at a local golf course for 9 holes. Some of the people who played were really good. The golf course was called Newport Beach Golf Course and I still go there from time to time.</p>

    <p>At first I was really bad so they gave me a really big handicap of over 20. Out of pure luck, I got first place. After that, I practiced and practiced. I went on a parent-child US kids tournament with my dad and got second place. Then I went on my first actual golf game. It was at Newport Beach. To get to the Players Tour, I had to get 8+ or less at least three times. I got 8+ all three times and got two 3rd places and one second place.</p>

    <p>After that, I went on my first Player's Tour game at David L. Baker Golf Course. I hit a 6+. I was in the division for 8 to 11 year olds. This division only played 9 holes, but from the 12-14 division, you had to play 18 holes so I stopped entering golf games for over a year. After a while, my dad convinced me to play and I played at Heartwell Golf Course. I did horribly, but I played another game the next month at David L. Baker, which I did horribly as well. I went on a total of 13 tournaments in 2023.</p>

    <p>My dad made me go on golf games other than David L. Baker and Heartwell so I started playing at Chester Washington Golf Course too. On my final game of the year, I played really good and got 3rd place with a score of 7+.</p>

    <p>In 2024, I started playing at Dad Miller Golf Course too. Although I haven't gotten a medal yet, I have improved my score significantly from last year, when I hit 18+'s on a regular basis.</p>

    <p>My bag is a blue and yellow Titleist and I use yellow golf balls because they are the easiest to find.</p>
