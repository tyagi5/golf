        <h3>Driving</h3>
        <p>Hit your drivers, woods, hybirds, and irons so that they go on the green. Unless you are confident you won't miss the shot, don't aim straight for the flag, especially if it is near the edge of the green.</p>

        <h3>Chipping</h3>
        <p>Although chipping doesn't seem very important, chipping is actually very important. If you are good at chipping you can hit your drivers and irons with ease, knowing that even if you miss the green, you will still be okay.</p>

        <p>Putting is the most important part of golf. Many people make the mistake of going to a driving range without putting. Putting makes up a lot of your score and can be the key to reduce your score.</p>
