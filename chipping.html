        <h2>No Backspin</h2>
        <p>If you are having trouble getting backspin for your ball, you shouldn't forcefully get backspin because it might mess up your swing. However, if you are getting less backspin than usual, you can straigten your wrists once you hit the ball, you should be able to get some more backspin.<p>

    <div>
        <h2>Too Low</h2>
        <img src="images/too low.jpeg" alt="demonstration">
        <p>Whenever you are chipping your ball low, make sure your club isn't being angled down and make sure your swing is mostly symetrical from the front.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Too High</h2>
        <img src="images/too high.jpeg" alt="demonstration">
        <p>I've rarely had this problem before, but if I did, I would try not to flick my wrists too early, or make my non-dominant hand line up with the club.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Duff</h2>
        <p>Make sure than your head isn't moving back when you swing. You should also make sure that you aren't flicking your wrists too early. Keep you spine from tilting to the left or the right as you hit the ball.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Top</h2>
        <p>Whenever you are hitting the ball thin a lot, you should keep your head from moving back or moving up. In short, keep your head in the same spot as you swing. </p>
