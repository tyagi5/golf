        <h2>List of Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't move your knees</li>
            <li>Don't follow the club of the ball with your eyes as you swing</li>
            <li>Keep your head down until your club finishes swinging</li>
            <li>Find a good putting rhythm: 65 bpm is what my coach suggested</li>
            <li>Form an isosceles triangle with you, your ball, and the hole to see if your putt is uphill or down</li>
            <li>Use your putter from outside of greens if ur ball has a good line to the hole and if you are at least 2 steps from the edge of the green</li>
            <li>Try the cross handed grip. I do this for long putts because it keeps me from hitting the ball to hard with my hands</li>
        </ul>

    
        <h2>Reading the Green</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Check the line by putting the hole in between yourself and your ball</li>
            <li>You can read the green better by reading the green from lowest part of your line</li>
            <li>Stand in front of the hole facing the hole or your ball and feel with your feet which way the green is tilted</li>
            <li>Watch other people's putts</li>
            <li>Find the highest part of the green</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Distance/Speed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Stand near the ball and imagine that you are putting until you get the right speed. Make sure that your rhythem isn't too fast</li>
            <li>Measure distances with your steps and practice the distances on the practice green so you know the speed of the green and how many steps your ball with roll depending on your swing</li>
            <li>If you are playing in the morning, the green might dry and make the green faster</li>
            <li>Watch other people's putts</li>
        </ul>
